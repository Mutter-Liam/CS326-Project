        <div class="into"><img class="intro-img" src="images/RetroBenFace.webp">Fairly tolerable in languages JS, J, C, or Python. Casually interested in game development, having contributed to the occasional game jam with friends and hobbyish personal projects, but professionally interested in front-end development. Low/moderate level of knowledge in Git, but has hobbyist knowledge of using it and directing a "team" at a Game Jam.

        <div class="into"><img class="intro-img" src="images/RetroSandroFace.png">The late night 6 hour plus programming session getting that one feature working is the single core experience of development, but I appreciate the grind, and with my working knowledge of JS and HTML, am excited to grind out this project with my awesome team. Having dabbled in game development, and computational linguistics research, I have familiarity with larger scale programming projects and am fairly proficient with Git/Github workflows.

        <div class="into"><img class="intro-img" src="images/RetroAdamFace.webp">I like the finer things in life, aka visuals. A project with an ugly interface is ugly to its core, no matter what the backend looks like. I like game development, front-end dev, and a dabble of python and sql based backend, and am a swiss army knife with git(hub Desktop). I’m not easy to please, and I’ll bring this attitude to this project. I will restore and invoke stern, hard-nosed, principled programming in everything I touch.

        <div class="into"><img class="intro-img" src="images/RetroLiamFace.png">I'm a backend andy. I'm interested in algorithm development and theoretical computer science. I have a bucnh of experience with HTML, CSS, JS as well as some C, Python and some other stuff. I volunteer at a lab which does projects with machine learning on MRI images. I also have done a lot of computational computer science in my physics classes. I'm still pretty new to Git but I have worked on some projects using it during a hackathon so hopefully it will click pretty fast.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>We at Team Voltron, as latter year college students, are familiar with what it's like to enter a class knowing nobody - it's difficult to spend time and energy reaching out to strangers to form a study group, and close to impossible to interact with the people in other class sections. To solve this problem, we intend to design an app / web application focused on allowing the public to share spontaneous / low-overhead meetings, with an initial particular focus on group studying. By holding intuitively easy to use tools, it should be very simple and quick for the layman to host a study session, homework get-together, or exam review, letting fellow students effortlessly and quickly join groups. At first, we will primarily be targeting college students, opening features with spontaneous study group formation / hosting, and specific support for the UMass Amherst area - but as the project goes along we could consider broader uses, such as general use by society at large or official use by organizations.</p>

                <h2>Application Parts</h2>
                <p>Rendezvous plans to have a content feed of sorts, that is, a list of ongoing / future events happening in the vicinity of the user in a text format for those who want a more conventional view of things happening in their area. To make its contents relevant to the user, users can subscribe to certain topics based on criteria such as a specific class, academic, or nonacademic purposes.</p>
                <p>Naturally, you'll also be able to click on these posts for more details, headcounts, a short description, regular occurrences, etc, set by the organizer of the event / question. Users will also be able to publicly reply to one another in the context of the post, either asking for more clarifications or answering whatever question the post poses. Users are encouraged to make legitimate events / answers by way of an account “karma” system, a positive-only reputation system that acts as an easy gauge of how trustworthy or helpful someone is.</p>
                <p>An interactive map view stands out as a more interactive, and visual aspect of the app: Rendezvous intends to use real-time GPS data to find and display any gatherings organized nearby with “pins” on a map, physically displaying where meetings are happening along with a brief title / description of what it is. Can be further filtered out much like the content feed, but further with geologically relevant constraints, such as a radius of search or highlighting certain pins based on the meeting's purpose, distance from a bus stop, etc.</p>
